# Specification
My search build has following requirements:

- Three pages: one for regular Google Search (index.html), one for Google Image Search (image.html), and one for Google Advanced Search (advanced.html).

- Links in the upper-right of each page navigates to the other two pages. 

- The Google Search button will take you to the Google search results for that page.

-Search bar and search button are centered with rounded corners. 

- The Google Image Search button (on the image.html page) will take you to the Google Image search results for that page.

- The Google Advanced Search button (on the advanced.html page) allows for four types of search :

> - Find pages with… “all these words:”

> - Find pages with… “this exact word or phrase:”

> - Find pages with… “any of these words:”

> - Find pages with… “none of these words:”

- The four options are stacked vertically, and all of the text fields are left aligned.

- The “Advanced Search” button should be blue with white text.

- When the “Advanced Search” button is clicked you are taken to the search results page for that given query.

- “I’m Feeling Lucky” button is available on the main index.html page. When you use this, you will encounter a redirect notice. This is an expected consequence of a security feature implemented by Google.

- The CSS you write should resemble Google’s own aesthetics.
